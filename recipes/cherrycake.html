        <p class="para">Amazingly easy and amazingly good... too good! This is my mother-in-law's recipe that was just recently shared. It would
        be a shame not to share it. Best served warm and with vanilla ice cream (of course).</p>
        <h3 class="subhead">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>2 (21 ounce) cans cherry pie filling</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="subhead">Directions</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread cherry pie filling over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Stir cake mix and butter together into a gooey,
            clumpy mixture. Break into pieces between your fingers and crumble evenly on top of the cherry filling. Sprinkle pecans
            on top.</li>
